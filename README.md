## Project Background

This project was born from the idea of creating a ticket management system similar to Jira Service Management or Freshdesk.

While searching for an open-source alternative, I came across many outdated projects filled with paid modules, others that are no longer open-source, and many that have been abandoned for years.

Alternatives like **TrueDesk** and **Peppermint** served as sources of inspiration for building this project.
